# Gitfetch

</div>

**Like neofetch but for GitHub**
> The approach of seeing your OS details, in `Neofetch` on terminal is cool, I thought why not for github as I'm using github on daily purpose and I need to check about my followers and stars etc, going back and forth on google and then github I found that a lot of work, I'm lazy.

# Running it locally Or Installing for your OS




# Development

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/gitfetch.git
$ cd gitfetch 
$ cargo run -- -t USERNAME
OR
$ cargo run -- -u USERNAME (this command will save your username)
```
to run your own or your friends github stats

```bash
$ cargo run -- -t USERNAME
```

# Plans
> I have a plan of making it more useful, by showing more information and using the graphQL api. There's still ton of work left.
